This is one of the beginner and best course in computer vision.,positive
i would like to include the advance version of this course as well.,CS
It is an excellent course for Phd students as it gives the broad vision of different research areas in Machine vision field.,positive
Presenting two papers 1 mid exam + 1 project are more than sufficient to give exposure of the vision field.,positive
I really learn a lot from this course which will definitely help me in my future research.,positive
This course should be offered in regular semester.,CS
The course is very good.,positive
We need more time to read more and more lessons.,CS
Also the project helped us implement real world applications that is further helpful if we plan to do research in this field.,CS
good course.,positive
Few more application specific contents is needed. ,CS
In-spite of term exams if we can focus more on the application area then the course will be a huge success.,CS
More Homework assignments would have helped to gain more knowledge.,CS
Must have some tutorials for of programming language.,CS
Ntg One word.,neutral
Amazing!.,positive
Please include Field trips.,CS
all is the best and i appreciate that.,positive
course is very well structured.,positive
I think an in class mini-project should be considered to be done step by step in during lectures.,CS
This course is a good subject with very interesting lectures.,positive
none to improve.,neutral
no comments/complaints here.,neutral
It could be beneficial for the course if we had assignments on case studies or the research papers.,CS
This course will help me in future in taking decisions.,positive
The course is great.,positive
1.This course deals with modern examples and also it can be improved in such a manner students can be able to apply to the modern day methods.,CS
2.Needs some more topics for the privacy methods while dealing with the data.,CS
its good.,positive
the reading presentations are not effective.,CS
Good course to learn new things and take good decisions using different decision making methods.,positive
This course is nice where we can learn so many things about how to deal with problems and make good decisions.,positive
In making decision do not rely on personal goal but it should be have a basis and data at hand before making decisions.,CS
This is a very useful course where we got an idea about decision making platform and also good for business management.,positive
This course is a great help in IM it talk alot of techniques metbod and models to help to improve certain organization in their decision making in terms if outcome.,positive
now it is very good.,positive
The course includes decision support models which are very useful.,positive
The course contains too many models and they all need practical implementation.,CS
So for this course I recommend at a lab session each week for practical use of the models.,CS
Also if the lab assistant/instructor is from the computer science/IM field would be better.,IS
Course was well structured however lacked in illustrating practical applications.,CS
Very good course easy to learn.,positive
Course is well organised.it was fun learning.,positive
Subject is so practical to learn many new things.,neutral

Okay.,neutral
the course has many interesting topics only overview of each topic was given could have tough a more practical approach where teaching about a data mining sofware and how to build a dss.,CS
Course is good.,positive
Course was a little abstract it touched upon too many topics but not in depth.,CS
Execution of project was a little hard.,CS
We should be given more examples of models being applied in real life situations.,CS
it would give us a better understanding of where DST is being used on a global scale.,CS
course was well designed.,positive
Please make the slide more expressive.,IS
GOOD.,positive

good.,positive
Assignments and homework are effective for learning.,CS
Course syllabus clearly defined learning objectives session-wise topics and readings.,positive
This course is important for us.,positive
Highly extensive and requires a good command on mathematical deduction and understanding.,CS
The course should include a lab class so that the student could apply it practically on the basis of what he/she has learned.,CS
The course meet my expectation.,neutral
Digital Communications is the most updated course in context of the modern world.,neutral
But I suggest this subject may also include the lab activities which will be effective for future.,CS
Give more time for basic programming learning as for many students the subject is very new,CS
Yes this course is a very good course for a beginner like me.,positive
"There were errors on a few hand outs , if it''s will be corrected.",CS
If videos of hand outs made and available to students will be a extra plus.,CS
Everything is okay.,neutral
But I suggest less theory and more practice.,CS
I found that the course was Rails specific.,CS
It would have been better it was a bit more generalized.,CS
The content is very modern and good.,positive
could have used a dedicated textbook.,CS
I think ruby is quite not used in real work.,CS
It should be better to use other language like python.,CS
It would be better if every student is required to do an individual project.,CS
Course is good and need to add some extra material.,CS
Should show the overall first then be more scope down to be know that which part are we now. ,CS
Not very specific at the beginning.,CS
We can't bring to apply in real life so much.,CS
It will be better if we had a TA.,CS
When instructor doing the practicals in the class its really hard to follow because of his speed.,CS
This is an important course for software engineers as we get to learn about the architectural patterns and also large enterprise software architectures.,positive
could use more real life examples.,CS
too much content not detail every topic.,CS
Maybe more assignments could have been given so that we could practice ourselves.,CS
The tutorials were too difficult to catch up in the class itself.,CS
Everything was fine.,neutral
This course spend too much time on programming tutorial which isn't quite effective because a lot of problems arise when perform the tutorial in class.,CS
I appreciate the material of the course as it has covered almost all the related topics. ,neutral

It would better if we can learn in way that positive and negative sides the data like data mining and data data commodities.,CS
Instead of Slides reading  case based study would add more in class learning and participation.,CS
The course is mostly focusing on the business topics but if practical implementation of technology is innovated would be better.,CS
E-business.,neutral
Maybe it can integrate real business case in the class and do some field trip to the company.,CS

innovative.,positive
The course material is good and I would be happy if the course contained most of the recent theories as well.,CS
Even though the material contains all the basic knowledge it would be better to have more practical knowledge.,CS
course 7 is a ripe field even today and I believe that all Computer Science students should have a good foundation of Data Structures.,neutral
The course at AIT is very informative and gives a chance for the students to develop a strong foundation based on which one can provide any programming solutions.,neutral
Perhaps a bit more lab work could be introduced to gain practical knowledge.,CS

Few assignments relating to the implementation aspect.,CS
I do not know how this course is going to help me in my real life.,IS
all is Perfect.,neutral
could be more interactive and practical with live examples.,IS
More examples required to get a better grip on the concepts.,CS
Also if we are provided with solutions of the problems it would help in cross in checking our answers.,CS
I would have scored more if I knew the correct answers for 2 questions.,CS
The followings are to be considered: .,neutral
the materials are really out dated.,CS

May be course outline should be reduced or focused more on some specific areas.,CS
Good.,positive
signals systems and stochastic.,neutral
Course is good.,positive
the course was easy enough to understand and follow even though I do not do GIS at work.,neutral
Perhaps in future classes with a big number of students there can be assistants to help the professors during lab sessions.,IS

So lab assistants would have been helpful.,CS
more time is required course have to be tailored to suit my background.,CS
