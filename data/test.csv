This is one of the beginner and best course in computer vision. i would like to include the advance version of this course as well.,,0
It is an excellent course for Phd students as it gives the broad vision of different research areas in Machine vision field. Presenting two papers 1 mid exam + 1 project are more than sufficient to give exposure of the vision field. I really learn a lot from this course which will definitely help me in my future research. This course should be offered in regular semester.,,1
The course is very good. We need more time to read more and more lessons.,,0
One of the very use full subjects for the New world and is base or core for many real life applications.,,1
This is a very useful and interesting course. We got a chance to better understand the concepts of an image is processed in order to extract useful information and get a glimpse of how they are implemented in real-world. Presenting the research papers and listening to presentations was really helpful and we got to learn a lot about these topics. Also the project helped us implement real world applications that is further helpful if we plan to do research in this field.,,1
good course.,,1
"Few more application specific contents is needed. In-spite of term exams, if we can focus more on the application area then the course will be a huge success.",,0
More Homework assignments would have helped to gain more knowledge.,,1
Must have some tutorials for of programming language.,,0
One word. Amazing!.,,1
