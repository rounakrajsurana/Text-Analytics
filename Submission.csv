This is one of the beginner and best course in computer vision.,1
i would like to include the advance version of this course as well.,0
It is an excellent course for Phd students as it gives the broad vision of different research areas in Machine vision field.,1
Presenting two papers 1 mid exam + 1 project are more than sufficient to give exposure of the vision field.,0
I really learn a lot from this course which will definitely help me in my future research.,1
This course should be offered in regular semester.,0
The course is very good.,1
We need more time to read more and more lessons.,0
One of the very use full subjects for the New world and is base or core for many real life applications.,0
This is a very useful and interesting course.,1
We got a chance to better understand the concepts of an image is processed in order to extract useful information and get a glimpse of how they are implemented in real-world.,1
Presenting the research papers and listening to presentations was really helpful and we got to learn a lot about these topics.,1
Also the project helped us implement real world applications that is further helpful if we plan to do research in this field.,1
good course.,1
Few more application specific contents is needed. ,0
In-spite of term exams if we can focus more on the application area then the course will be a huge success.,0
More Homework assignments would have helped to gain more knowledge.,0
Must have some tutorials for of programming language.,0
Ntg One word.,1
Amazing!.,1
Please include Field trips.,0
all is the best and i appreciate that.,1
course is very well structured.,1
I think an in class mini-project should be considered to be done step by step in during lectures.,0
This course is a good subject with very interesting lectures.,1
none to improve.,0
no comments/complaints here.,0
It could be beneficial for the course if we had assignments on case studies or the research papers.,0
This course will help me in future in taking decisions.,1
The course is great.,1
1.This course deals with modern examples and also it can be improved in such a manner students can be able to apply to the modern day methods.,0
2.Needs some more topics for the privacy methods while dealing with the data.,1
its good.,1
the reading presentations are not effective.,0
Good course to learn new things and take good decisions using different decision making methods.,1
This course is nice where we can learn so many things about how to deal with problems and make good decisions.,1
In making decision do not rely on personal goal but it should be have a basis and data at hand before making decisions.,0
This is a very useful course where we got an idea about decision making platform and also good for business management.,1
This course is a great help in IM it talk alot of techniques metbod and models to help to improve certain organization in their decision making in terms if outcome.,1
now it is very good.,1
The course includes decision support models which are very useful.,1
The course contains too many models and they all need practical implementation.,0
So for this course I recommend at a lab session each week for practical use of the models.,0
Also if the lab assistant/instructor is from the computer science/IM field would be better.,0
Course was well structured however lacked in illustrating practical applications.,0
Very good course easy to learn.,1
Course is well organised.it was fun learning.,0
Subject is so practical to learn many new things.,0
usefull course.,1
