comments,suggestion,
i would like to include the advance version of this course as well.,CS,neutral
This course should be offered in regular semester.,CS,neutral
We need more time to read more and more lessons.,CS,neutral
Also the project helped us implement real world applications that is further helpful if we plan to do research in this field.,CS,neutral
Few more application specific contents is needed. ,CS,neutral
In-spite of term exams if we can focus more on the application area then the course will be a huge success.,CS,neutral
More Homework assignments would have helped to gain more knowledge.,CS,neutral
Must have some tutorials for of programming language.,CS,neutral
Please include Field trips.,CS,neutral
I think an in class mini-project should be considered to be done step by step in during lectures.,CS,neutral
It could be beneficial for the course if we had assignments on case studies or the research papers.,CS,neutral
1.This course deals with modern examples and also it can be improved in such a manner students can be able to apply to the modern day methods.,CS,neutral
2.Needs some more topics for the privacy methods while dealing with the data.,CS,neutral
the reading presentations are not effective.,CS,neutral
In making decision do not rely on personal goal but it should be have a basis and data at hand before making decisions.,CS,neutral
The course contains too many models and they all need practical implementation.,CS,neutral
So for this course I recommend at a lab session each week for practical use of the models.,CS,neutral
Course was well structured however lacked in illustrating practical applications.,CS,neutral
Course was a little abstract it touched upon too many topics but not in depth.,CS,neutral
Execution of project was a little hard.,CS,neutral
We should be given more examples of models being applied in real life situations.,CS,neutral
it would give us a better understanding of where DST is being used on a global scale.,CS,neutral
Assignments and homework are effective for learning.,CS,neutral
Highly extensive and requires a good command on mathematical deduction and understanding.,CS,neutral
The course should include a lab class so that the student could apply it practically on the basis of what he/she has learned.,CS,neutral
But I suggest this subject may also include the lab activities which will be effective for future.,CS,neutral
However I believe the content of the course was a lot to cover up in just one semester.,CS,neutral
Give more time for basic programming learning as for many students the subject is very new,CS,neutral
"There were errors on a few hand outs , if it''s will be corrected.",CS,neutral
If videos of hand outs made and available to students will be a extra plus.,CS,neutral
But I suggest less theory and more practice.,CS,neutral
I found that the course was Rails specific.,CS,neutral
It would have been better it was a bit more generalized.,CS,neutral
could have used a dedicated textbook.,CS,neutral
I think ruby is quite not used in real work.,CS,neutral
It should be better to use other language like python.,CS,neutral
It would be better if every student is required to do an individual project.,CS,neutral
Course is good and need to add some extra material.,CS,neutral
Should show the overall first then be more scope down to be know that which part are we now. ,CS,neutral
Not very specific at the beginning.,CS,neutral
We can't bring to apply in real life so much.,CS,neutral
It will be better if we had a TA.,CS,neutral
When instructor doing the practicals in the class its really hard to follow because of his speed.,CS,neutral
could use more real life examples.,CS,neutral
too much content not detail every topic.,CS,neutral
Maybe more assignments could have been given so that we could practice ourselves.,CS,neutral
The tutorials were too difficult to catch up in the class itself.,CS,neutral
This course spend too much time on programming tutorial which isn't quite effective because a lot of problems arise when perform the tutorial in class.,CS,neutral
It would be helpful if there are more assignments given to students.,CS,neutral
It would better if we can learn in way that positive and negative sides the data like data mining and data data commodities.,CS,neutral
Instead of Slides reading  case based study would add more in class learning and participation.,CS,neutral
The course is mostly focusing on the business topics but if practical implementation of technology is innovated would be better.,CS,neutral
Maybe it can integrate real business case in the class and do some field trip to the company.,CS,neutral
I request the course to more interactive.,CS,neutral
A very interesting and an useful course which will help our country to feed better by implementing many government online services\nTime for intern so shoort.,CS,neutral
This subject should provide on Jan oe Aug Semester.,CS,neutral
This Course has more related to data structure and algorithms which can be used for many real life applications.,CS,neutral
Need to include some programming stuff.,CS,neutral
It would be good if we can study the algorithms from a simple programming language like python.,CS,neutral
It is one of the fundamental subjects for Computer Science students and it is really useful in real-world practices (not only in academic areas.,CS,neutral
The course material is good and I would be happy if the course contained most of the recent theories as well.,CS,neutral
Even though the material contains all the basic knowledge it would be better to have more practical knowledge.,CS,neutral
Perhaps a bit more lab work could be introduced to gain practical knowledge.,CS,neutral
We got a chance to better understand these concepts and get a glimpse of how they are implemented in real-world.,CS,neutral
If possible should add more sample application which is used in real life.,CS,neutral
Including how things are done today would have been more useful.,CS,neutral
Few assignments relating to the implementation aspect.,CS,neutral
More examples required to get a better grip on the concepts.,CS,neutral
Also if we are provided with solutions of the problems it would help in cross in checking our answers.,CS,neutral
I would have scored more if I knew the correct answers for 2 questions.,CS,neutral
the materials are really out dated.,CS,neutral
the method of teaching is poor.,CS,neutral
This course is really\nchallenging I thing it should be removed from IM syllabus.,CS,neutral
Things are not practical in this subject.,CS,neutral
This course only has Two exams Which is not a wise approach.,CS,neutral
It should have some projects and homework so the students can score.,CS,neutral
The course should contain more practical applications related to the concepts we are studying so that we would be able to visualize its real\nlife advantages.,CS,neutral
Should be more detailed.,CS,neutral
Since this subjects difficulties is already high it became more challenging as it became close book.,CS,neutral
The was very hard to follow for the students who have poor background.,CS,neutral
May be course outline should be reduced or focused more on some specific areas.,CS,neutral
So lab assistants would have been helpful.,CS,neutral
more time is required course have to be tailored to suit my background.,CS,neutral
However I think that the course should have more significant assignment works.,CS,neutral
We were assigned simple assignments.,CS,neutral
It would be interesting to work on recent events and have detailed interpretation of disasters through RS and GIS.,CS,neutral
Needed simplified explanation and practical learning.,CS,neutral
However  If there is a chance to use more advanced mapping equipment it could be very great for the students.,CS,neutral
Prepared just in time perfect for the recent technology developments.,CS,neutral
frankly the only thing I felt was immense class strength.,CS,neutral
lot of people seriously  I think this course should be offered on a first come first serve basis.,CS,neutral
course could have been much better if the material was fair enough.,CS,neutral
Excellent course for computer vision students as this course discuss many geometry algorithms which we may need during our research.,CS,neutral
This course should offer in regular semester.,CS,neutral
Tutorial should be updated so bugs will be decreased.,CS,neutral
We didnt have assignments after mid-term exam.,CS,neutral
As it is very deep subject and very hard to memories all the lecture in class at once better have video lectures also so that we can look them when we are studying and get some more information.thank-you.,CS,neutral
This course requires some basic knowledge of Python coding not just math.,CS,neutral
So should have per-requitite or pre-requirement for this course.,CS,neutral
Though course teaching method is very good it would also really help if there will be a separate basic refresher / tutorial of linear algebra / maths relevant to the course and it corresponding python code.,CS,neutral
There good aspects to the lecturer teaching and experience but I think More preparation is required for conducting lectures. ,CS,neutral
Available resources.,CS,neutral
We should think differently to answer and its very useful.,CS,neutral
Most of them contain only bullets showing the topic but no description and details in order to understand the topic itself and in class teaching many bullets/topics have been skipped or no explanation at all.,CS,neutral
The exam questions are too easy and not challenging at all.,CS,neutral
He had all the resources in hand both theoretical as well as the contents for practical work.,CS,neutral
I think he have done to the extent for improving the course.,CS,neutral
to involve more information.,CS,neutral
Please to showing something more pratical.,CS,neutral
Maybe a laboratory would help too.,CS,neutral
I understand the course more when I do my project.,CS,neutral
I do preferred to have more assignment to help me focusing on the key point of each chapter.,CS,neutral
