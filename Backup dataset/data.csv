ReviewComment,,
This is one of the beginner and best course in computer vision. i would like to include the advance version of this course as well.,,
It is an excellent course for Phd students as it gives the broad vision of different research areas in Machine vision field. Presenting two papers 1 mid exam + 1 project are more than sufficient to give exposure of the vision field. I really learn a lot from this course which will definitely help me in my future research. This course should be offered in regular semester.,,
The course is very good. We need more time to read more and more lessons.,,
One of the very use full subjects for the New world and is base or core for many real life applications,,
This is a very useful and interesting course. We got a chance to better understand the concepts of an image is processed in order to extract useful information and get a glimpse of how they are implemented in real-world. Presenting the research papers and listening to presentations was really helpful and we got to learn a lot about these topics. Also the project helped us implement real world applications that is further helpful if we plan to do research in this field.,,
good course,,
"Few more application specific contents is needed. In-spite of term exams,if we can focus more on the application area then the course will be a huge success.",,
More Homework assignments would have helped to gain more knowledge.,,
Must have some tutorials for of programming language,,
Ntg,,
One word. Amazing!,,
Please include Field trips.,,
all is the best and i appreciate that.,,
course is very well structured,,
None,,
I think an in class mini-project should be considered to be done step by step in during lectures,,
This course is a good subject with very interesting lectures,,
none to improve,,
no comments/complaints here.,,
It could be beneficial for the course if we had assignments on case studies or the research papers.,,
This course will help me in future in taking decisions,,
The course is great,,
1.This course deals with modern examples and also it can be improved in such a manner students can be able to apply to the modern day methods. 2.Needs some more topics for the privacy methods while dealing with the data.,,
its good,,
the reading presentations are not effective,,
Good course to learn new things and take good decisions using different decision making methods,,
This course is nice where we can learn so many things about how to deal with problems and make good decisions. In making decision do not rely on personal goal but it should be have a basis and data at hand before making decisions.,,
This is a very useful course where we got an idea about decision making platform and also good for business management.,,
This course is a great help in IM, it talk alot of techniques, metbod and models to help to improve certain organization in their decision making in terms if outcome.
now it is very good,,
The course includes decision support models which are very useful.,,
The course contains too many models and they all need practical implementation. So for this course I recommend at a lab session each week for practical use of the models. Also if the lab assistant/instructor is from the computer science/IM field would be better.,,
Course was well structured, however lacked in illustrating practical applications.,
Very good course easy to learn,,
Course is well organised..it was fun learning,,
Subject is so practical to learn many new things.,,
usefull course,,
Decision Support Technologies is a required course of IM course. It is dealt as it was meant to be.,,
very good course and it is very helpfull,,
The course material was good. Its more wide than I had expected. So I am happy to take this course and it,,
has broaden my knowledge and will also help during my thesis work.,,
useful,,
Course was excellent. It helped me to make better Decisions.,,
Okay,,
the course has many interesting topics only overview of each topic was given could have tough a more practical approach where teaching about a data mining sofware and how to build a dss,,
Course is good,,
Course was a little abstract , it touched upon too many topics but not in depth. Execution of project was a little hard.,
We should be given more examples of models being applied in real life situations. it would give us a better understanding of where DST is being used on a global scale.,,
course was well designed.,,
Please make the slide more expressive.,,
GOOD,,
It nice course,,
The course syllabus clearly state its target topics and objectives. It is also clear to student on what are the things they need to learn. So far the course syllabus is effectuve for guiding me in acquiring knowledge about digital communication.,,
very good course,,
Slides should be make more understable.,,
good,,
Assignments and homework are effective for learning. Course syllabus clearly defined learning objectives,session-wise topics and readings.,
This course is important for us.,,
Highly extensive and requires a good command on mathematical deduction and understanding,,
The course should include a lab class so that the student could apply it practically on the basis of what he/she has learned.,,
The course meet my expectation.,,
Digital Communications is the most updated course in context of the modern world. But I suggest this subject may also include the lab activities which will be effective for future.,,
good,,
The course was up to date,,
It is one of the fundamental subjects for Computer Science students and helped us gain an insight into real world web-development.,,
However, I believe the content of the course was a lot to cover up in just one semester.,
An excellent course to learn almost every part of web application engineering.,,
It is an interesting course and useful for real life in programming.,,
Give more time for basic programming learning as for many students the subject is very new,,
Yes, this course is a very good course for a beginner like me.,
Nothing,,
There were errors on a few hand outs , if it's will be corrected. If videos of hand outs made and available to students will be a extra plus.,
Everything is okay. But I suggest less theory and more practice,,
I found that the course was Rails specific. It would have been better it was a bit more generalized.,,
The content is very modern and good.,,
could have used a dedicated textbook,,
I think ruby is quite not used in real work. It should be better to use other language like python.,,
It would be better if every student is required to do an individual project.,,
Course is good and need to add some extra material.,,
Should show the overall first, then be more scope down to be know that which part are we now. Not very specific at the beginning. We can't,
bring to apply in real life so much.,,
It will be better if we had a TA. When instructor doing the practicals in the class its really hard to follow because of his speed.,,
This is an important course for software engineers as we get to learn about the architectural patterns and also large enterprise software architectures,,
could use more real life examples,,
too much content, not detail every topic,
Maybe more assignments could have been given so that we could practice ourselves. The tutorials were too difficult to catch up in the class itself.,,
Everything was fine.,,
This course spend too much time on programming tutorial which isn't quite effective because a lot of problems arise when perform the tutorial in class.,,
I appreciate the material of the course, as it has covered almost all the related topics. The course is also up to date with the latest version of the book.,
It is very interesting and useful.,,
Materials are not up to date,,
Interesting,,
good,,
None.,,
Ebusiness,,
The course is so interesting and it gives techniques to manage online businesses.,,
None,,
Course C4,,
It would be helpful if there are more assignments given to students.,,
The course is well organised. the course is useful.,,
A very good and useful subject,,
It would better if we can learn in way that positive and negative sides the data like data mining and data data commodities.,,
Instead of Slides reading, case based study would add more in class learning and participation.,
The course is mostly focusing on the business topics but if practical implementation of technology is innovated would be better.,,
E-business,,
Maybe it can integrate real business case in the class and do some field trip to the company.,,
As per the course it is excellent and contents are fine. I request the course to more interactive,,
No comments,,
Good,,
This course helped me a lot, which incrementally increased my interest in the subject.,
ok,,
Nice teacher and helpful,,
Course and course materials were excellent,,
the instructor is very professional and teach according to the level of the students. very encouraging and give new ideas of research in e-gov field,,
This class is very interesting and useful.,,
can ask us to use a e-government portal and describe as an assignment and meet government executives,,
none,,
good,,
This course is very good for learning.,,
Course is very well organised.,,
The course helps us to gain knowledge in the field of ICT in government.,,
effective in learning e-government projects,,
Nice course,,
Excellent,,
It is useful course,,
The course was very interesting and gives knowledge about various things,,
By learning the real time examples of e-government with the help of assignments, study report and also learning it from other students gave a,
clear sketch of the course.,,
Good,,
Course was interesting.I came to know many things through this course and it helped me to know better about e-governments,,
Course is perfect,,
A very interesting and an useful course which will help our country to feed better by implementing many government online services,,
Time for intern so shoort. This subject should provide on Jan oe Aug Semester,,
Course met my expectations.,,
The course is good.,,
I am realy satisfied from the course from /teaching methods/resource materials and other sttafs.,,
Good,,
This Course has more related to data structure and algorithms, which can be used for many real life applications.,
I have taken the same course in my bachelors degree. But in this semester i learned lot new things in the course. The course curriculum is awesome,,
Few topics in the course were kind of revision from my UG and I new topics were clear.,,
Course outline is perfect. Everything we need to know in Data Structure and Algorithms is included in this course. Moreover, within the given limited time, it can be said that it is perfect course.
Good,,
it is ok,,
No Comment,,
Need to include some programming stuff.,,
It would be good if we can study the algorithms from a simple programming language like python.,,
Excellent,,
It is one of the fundamental subjects for Computer Science students and it is really useful in real-world practices (not only in academic areas).,,
innovative,,
The course material is good, and I would be happy if the course contained most of the recent theories as well. Even though the material contains all the basic knowledge, it would be better to have more practical knowledge.
course 7 is a ripe field even today and I believe that all Computer Science students should have a good foundation of Data Structures. The course at AIT is very informative and gives a chance for the students to develop a strong foundation based on which one can provide any programming solutions.,,
Perhaps a bit more lab work could be introduced to gain practical knowledge.,,
This is a very useful and interesting course for students who are interested in data mining and the retrieval of information. We got a chance to better understand these concepts and get a glimpse of how they are implemented in real-world.,,
The course is extremely helpful for students are new to the data mining field.,,
The course are really nice and the materials are helpful towards the preset scenario of data.,,
ok,,
The theory part is useful. If possible should add more sample application which is used in real life,,
It is good course.TT,,
Including how things are done today would have been more useful. Few assignments relating to the implementation aspect.,,
Great,,
I do not know how this course is going to help me in my real life.,,
all is Perfect,,
could be more interactive and practical with live examples,,
More examples required to get a better grip on the concepts. Also, if we are provided with solutions of the problems, it would help in cross-
checking our answers. I would have scored more if I knew the correct answers for 2 questions.,,
The followings are to be considered: . the materials are really out dated. 2002... . the method of teaching is poor. . This course is really,,
challenging I thing it should be removed from IM syllabus. . things are not practical in this subject. > This course only has Two exams, Which is not a wise approach. > It should have some projects and homework so the students can score.,
Good ,,
excellent,,
